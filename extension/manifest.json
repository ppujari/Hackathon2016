    "description": "Walmart product reviews are immensely useful to the customers as well as the analytics teams. However, writing good reviews is a cumbersome task which is why many products suffer from little or no reviews at all. Our hack aims at bringing a boost to the user engagement in review writing. We present an intelligent interface that can assist the user, as they type, by automatically generating score, title, and meaningful tags. We also show how these auto-generated scores, tags, and titles can help the analytics teams detect various inconsistencies in human-generated reviews.  We can  detect when things change suddenly.  We can identify seasonal trends too.",
